          Form I - 9, officially the Employment Eligibility Verification, is a 
          United States Citizenship and Immigration Services form.Mandated by the 
          Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is used to verify the identity 
          and legal authorization to work of all paid employees in the United States.
          All U.S.employers must ensure proper completion of Form I - 9
          for each individual they hire for employment in the United States
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The I - 9 is not required for unpaid volunteers or for contractors.
        However, a company could still find itself liable
        if it contracts work to a contractor it knows either is or employs unauthorized workers.
        Multiple versions of Form I - 9, Employment Eligibility Verification, have been issued since 
        the form was first introduced in 1987;
        not all versions are valid
        for use.Currently, only forms showing the following revision date are valid: "Rev. 07/17/2017 N*".

          employment.The employer must complete Section 2 within three days of the employee's starting date at work

          If an employee cannot read or cannot write in English, a translator or preparer may complete the form and sign it
